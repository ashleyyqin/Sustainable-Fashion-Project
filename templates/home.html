    <h1 class="about">ABOUT THE CURATOR</h1>
    <p class="mylilheader">sustainable fashion will sustain fashion.</p>
    <p class="myFont">Hi, my name's Ashley, and I'm a 19 year old college student trying to make sustainable clothing more
        mainstream.</p>
    <p class="myFont">Fast fashion puts an unbelievable amount of strain on the environment. The dyeing chemicals used
        in fast fashion
        are the second largest polluter of clean water. Non-organic cotton used in fast fashion requires insane amounts
        of water
        and pesticides to produce, causing health consequences for all living organisms in the surrounding areas. Since
        fast fashion is made for fleeting trends rather than long-term wear, clothing from this industry ends up in
        landfills leaving toxic chemicals and dyes to contaminate local soil and groundwater.</p>
    <p class="myFont">Presented on this site are four aesthetics that are popular amongst people my age and that I
        personally like to
        work into my own style. I have painstakingly scoured the internet for sustainable dupes
        for the outfits showcased in each aesthetic's gallery.</p>
    <p class="myFont">Thanks so much for stopping by; I hope this website opens your eyes to the world of clothing that
        not only looks
        great but is great for the future of our Earth :)</p>

    <h1 class="aboutsite">HOW THIS SITE WORKS</h1>
    <p class="mylilheader">DISCLAIMER: I am not sponsored by any of the brands that may be featured on this site.</p>
    <p class="myFont">A gallery corresponding to each aesthetic contains outfits that I feel represent each style well.
        If you like something you see, click on the picture and a link to a sustainable dupe for the piece of clothing
        you picked will open in a new tab! Great for exploring sustainable brands!</p>
